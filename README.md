Project 3: GDP and life expectancy

by Michel Wermelinger, 27 August 2015, updated 5 April 2016

This is the project notebook for Week 3 of The Open University's Learn to code for Data Analysis course.

Richer countries can afford to invest more on healthcare, on work and road safety, and other measures that reduce mortality. On the other hand, richer countries may have less healthy lifestyles. Is there any relation between the wealth of a country and the life expectancy of its inhabitants?

The following analysis checks whether there is any correlation between the total gross domestic product (GDP) of a country in 2013 and the life expectancy of people born in that country in 2013.

**Remember If you want to execute the project, you should have installed the Anaconda package 3 with IPython Notebook. http://http://www.open.edu/openlearn/learn-to-code-installation
